### Some of the tech stacks
1. Typescript.
2. Redux Toolkit
3. Redux Persist (For local storage)

### Notes
I have tried my best to make the app as real as possible with proper UI/UX & at the same time I have tried to keep the project structure neat and clean.  
That's why I added some extra details in the given data-set. Hopefully that's okay.

### Limitations
Of course with the time limit and scope there are lots of limitations. I have finished this task within 2days, of course with the full time job. I am sure that 
I have not handled a lot of the edge cases which will appear for a real-world projects. I wish I could add more to it, I really enjoyed working on the task.
